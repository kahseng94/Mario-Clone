Code quality:
1. The class Names are easy understand and follows the consistency. 
2. Codes are highly maintainable.
3. Minimum extra dependencies
4. code is high cohesion
5. code is low coupling


Hypothetical change: 
Although, CheatReader and KeyBoardController have interdependent relation, they still have loose coupling. It is because the when you change something about the cheat reader in the keyboardcontroller class, it would not chnage the behaviour of the CheatReader class.
