Specific comments on code quality:
- The names of variables and methods are clear
- Clear and understandable design and implementation.- Code is cohesive only dealing with item collisions
- Code is dependent only on what's necessary (low coupling).
- Easily maintainable 

Hypothetical change:
By adding the lakitu files, other enemy classes will not be changed.Therefore, these classes is loose coupling.
