Specific comments on code Readability:
-Code is highly readable
-Clear variable and method names
-Good code format
- Most method functions are apparent by name, no need for in line comments.

Hypothetical Change:
By adding additional code of the files that are being review, it would not change the behaviour of the other command classes. Therefore, it is loose coupling.
