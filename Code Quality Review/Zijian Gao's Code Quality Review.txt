Code Readability:
1. Understandable class Names. 
2. High cohesion.
3. Low coupling.
4. Code are maintainable.
5. minimum extra dependencies.


Hypothetical change: 
When we add a new block files such as a underwater block, the GrayBrick.cs and GrayFixBrick.cs will not change. Therefore, these classes are loose coupling.
