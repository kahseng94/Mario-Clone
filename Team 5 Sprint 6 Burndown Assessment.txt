Team 5 Sprint 6 Burndown

The most challenging aspect of Sprint 6 was probably deciding which features to implement. Once that decision was made, the challenge was figuring out how to integrate those ideas into the existing project. Previous sprints built on one another and there was a logical flow of features and extensions. Certain aspects of Sprint 6, such as adding a new enemy type and adding new level design features, required the tweaking of more interfaces than any of the previous sprints since some of the features were entirely unique. Even though the features were new and required different implementations, having so much of the foundational logic completed made the new additions surprisingly manageable. Another nice feature of Sprint 6 is that everyone on the team got to work on something they were interested in and found ways to make the game more engaging. All that together made Sprint 6 feel like less of a drag and a lot more open ended than the rest of the semester.

Organizationally, we were able to complete our new features with plenty of time before the due date. This was even though we were working more independently than during previous sprints and that some of the changes made, especially with enemy classes, interfered with other changes made and other features added. Overall, we definitely became more streamlined as a group and gained efficiency and trust over the course of the semester.
